# Spark-3-Mastery-Mode  
Mode that makes enemies tougher and meaner, along with other changes.  

2.0 is OUT! There are now hints for better play in the Shopalo item descriptions, and new medals for all the levels up to Saw Man.  

All medal targets are set without using magnet dashing. If you want to get the full challenge out of the new targets, don't use magnet dash (the trick where you dash after a homing attack for a huge boost of speed). Make good use of the other tools you have to gain speed.
