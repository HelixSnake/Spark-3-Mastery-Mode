# Spark-3-Mastery-Mode  
Mode that makes enemies tougher and meaner, along with other changes.  

0.3.0 is OUT! There is now a better hint menu, magnet dashes have been rebalanced, after beating Final Utopia the individual segments unlock as levels, and there are new medals for all the levels in Areas 1 and 2.  

Magnet dashes are now allowed because they've been made less powerful but more consistent.
